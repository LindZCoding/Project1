How to play:
You are a player who got sent to space on a mission to collect all the stars to save the planet from destruction. The catch... the player has to dodge meteors while collecting stars. Once you collect a certain amount of stars you win. If you hit a meteor the player dies and the planet will be destroyed.

MVP
*Create a start game screen with instructions
*Create a top down view of game that also displays players points
*Render a space character that moves with WASD keys in between the lines
*Render multiple meteors that go down the screen between the lines, if any meteor hits the player the game is over
*Create a restart button
*If the player dodges a meteor or a star have it disappear off screen
*Render multiple stars that go down the screen for the player to collect for points
*Have a game ending victory screen if the player collects all stars 

Stretch Goals
*Have the player be able to shoot the meteors
*The stars the player collects makes the meteors slower which makes surviving easier
*Have it to where meteor pieces randomly break off making it harder to dodge

Potential Roadblocks
*Getting in my own head 
*Setting up a start and ending screen
*Linking collecting stars to points
*Having the player alternate between lanes
