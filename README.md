# Draco Meteor
**How to play:**
* You are a player who got sent to space on a mission to collect all the stars to save the planet from destruction. The catch... the player has to dodge meteors while collecting stars. Once you collect 50 stars you win and save the planet. If you hit a meteor the player dies and the planet will be destroyed.

**Tech stack**
* JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

**MVP**
* Create a start game button 
* Create a top down view of game that also displays players points
* Render a space character that moves with "AD" keys that go left & right in between the lines
* Render multiple meteors that go down the screen between the lines, if any meteor hits the player the game is over
* Create a restart button
* If the player dodges a meteor or a star have it disappear off screen
* Render multiple stars that go down the screen for the player to collect for points
* Have a game ending victory screen if the player collects 50 stars 

**Stretch Goals**
* Have the player be able to shoot the meteors
* The stars the player collects makes the meteors slower which makes surviving easier
* Have it to where meteor pieces randomly break off making it harder to dodge
* Have different levels of difficulty 

**Potential Roadblocks**
* Getting in my own head 
* Setting up a start and ending screen
* Linking collecting stars to points
* Having the player alternate between lanes
